ES == EcmaScript
ES6(2015) and beyond == Modern Javascript. Yearly releases after 2015

Number = Floating point numbers // decimals and integers

String = Used for text // Always put in quotes

Boolean = Logical // Always true or false

Undefined = Value taken by variable that is empty(not yet defined)  let children;

Null = Also means 'empty value'

Symbol (ES2015) = Value that is unique and cannot be changed

BigInt (ES2020) =  Larger integers than the Number type can hold

Dynamic Typing = We do not have to manually define the data type of the value stored in a variable. Data types are determined automatically // Value has type, NOT variable!

let x = 23; 
let x = 'twenty three';


mutate variable
const = immutable variable

const preferred unless you know the variable will change, then use let
